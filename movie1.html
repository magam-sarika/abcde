Produced by <b>Bellamkonda Suresh</b> under Sri Sai Ganesh Productions banner, it stars <i><b>Gopichand and Priyamani</b></i> and features music composed by <b>Chakri</b>.

Shortly after his appointment as Sub-Inspector, he dramatically apprehends some criminals, DIG Bharath Nandan appoints him as an Encounter Specialist, gives him a separate police station, four assistants, and complete authority to kill known gangsters. Gangaram unleashes a reign of terror, killing many gangsters, and forcing many others to flee and/or give up on crime altogether. He sets up his own network with the assistance of prostitutes and other petty criminals that he bails out, and with the reward money from the Government, sets up an orphanage. A pretty Event Organizer/male-hater, whose mother, Arundhati, also a male/marriage-hater, is impressed and falls in love with him. After he eliminates gangster Talwar, he is all set to travel to Kenya to confront the second, more deadly gangster, Khalid, whose roots are in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. For this purpose, he is asked to tender his resignation, to which he agrees. And it is this decision that will result in his arrest for Extortion and accepting bribes.</p>
